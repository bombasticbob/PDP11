=======

THE SOFTWARE itself is covered by a dual license.  You may choose one
or the other, but not both (since they are usually not compatible with
one another anyway).

The two license choices are:
  a) MIT-style LICENSE
  b) STANDARD GPL or LGPL LICENSE

Additionally, other copyrights may also apply, for code that may be
considered to have been 'derived'.  These are currently displayed within
the source code at the appropriate places, for reference.

THIS SOFTWARE IS BEING PROVIDED AS-IS, WITH NO WARRANTY WHATSOEVER.  USE
IT AT YOUR OWN RISK.  THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS CLAIM NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR
ANY ACTIONS OR CONSEQUENCES THAT MAY ARISE FROM THE USE, ABUSE, OR
DISTRIBUTION OF THIS SOFTWARE.

For the actual license text, see LICENSE.


NOTE:  The term 'DECtape' (with upper case 'DEC') is a product that
was made by Digital Equipment Corporation.  The application name is
intentionally different with enough similarity to the product name
to indicate its purpose.
